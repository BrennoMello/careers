# Teams

## Data
We have the mission of gathering and structuring all Brazilian public data. There's a vast amount of valuable public Data out there. The applications for it are yet to be discovered, ranging from public transparency to increasing the access to justice and making the whole legal system a lot more efficient. We empower more than 30 million monthly users through a platform developed using top-tier technology, from Distributed Systems to Artificial Intelligence, processing Terabytes of data - And we're still only scratching the surface.

On a daily basis, you'll be helping the team to thrive by implementing data extractors, key components for our services, reviewing pull requests and actively helping to plan our roadmap.

## Distribution
Our team has the mission to create a great user experience for almost 30 millions unique visitors by month, displaying millions of documents, helping the lawyerâ€™s workflow and allowing citizens to find their rights.

## ERP

## Marketplaces
In this team we're developing tools for lawyers to improve their performance and reduce pain points. Jusbrasil has 700 thousand lawyers profiles, this is an open line of communication to understand their needs and create the best product possible. It is a continuous effort of the team to get insights for new features with customer development, surveys and benchmarks.

## Payment
Do you know how important is that payment form page that you cross sometimes at almost any available service in the web? Our job starts there and go through a bunch more of great challenges! We handle every customer subscription, making sure that they all receives what they're paying for; we have to communicate to multiple services to guarantee that the best route is chosen for each individual payment made to our products; and of course we need to know what need to be improved and how to improve it. Our job, besides programming services that reaches almost 20 million people every month (and still growing) is to collect, analyse and act over data from each of our services!
